# QuizApp : A naive quiz-app for Android

## Things I learnt while building this app
- Layouting UI elements
- Create Custom Java Classes to satisfy given use-cases.
- Intents and Message-passing through Intents
- Android App Activity Life Cycle
- Setting Custom App Icons

## Future Scopes of the App
- Implement user-accounts for using the app. Sign-in and authentication can be done using **Firebase**
- Dynamic Quiz Questions - Fetch questions from **RESTful Quiz Services** and serve them in the app
- Create a social center in-app so that users can chat/socialize amongst themselves
